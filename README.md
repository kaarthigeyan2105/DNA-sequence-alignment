Sequence alignment algorithms are essential tools in bioinformatics for comparing biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. 
These algorithms help identify similarities and differences between sequences.
It is crucial for understanding evolutionary relationships, identifying functional elements, and predicting the effects of mutations.
